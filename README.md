# Score-Tracker

- Create a JavaScript program that accepts user input as a score

- The maximum score should be 100, and the least score to be 0

- If user input is between 0 and 30, it should return the string “Try Harder your score is low!”

- If the user input is between 31 to 60 it should return “Hey that is a good score but you can do better!”

- If the user input is between 61 to 100 it should return “Wow you did great!”

- Else if the score is below 0 or above 100, return “Please insert a valid score!”
